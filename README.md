# Hall Management System
This is one of my undergraduate project with my teammate Tofayel Ahmmed Babu (https://github.com/TofayelAhmmedBabu/)

# About The Project
Hall Management System Integrated User Interface is a PC app to maintain institutional things more efficiently. More precisely, it’s a PC app where institute specially university can maintain its hall or student residential things more effectively as well as it’s also user friendly where student can register themselves as well as can interact with hall admins. The basic summary of the project can be divided into following three categories-

❖ Registration Phase: By opening of the app, user will get an interface where user can register themselves as an admin [Verified by the institution] as well as general user i.e. student.

❖ Admin Panel: By login as an admin, admin will get an overview of this app as an admin with several features like as Dining Management, Room Management, Staffs Management and so on. Admin can easily view his profile, update his profile if necessary, can view the current status of each room and can insert or modify room status very effectively. Admin can also modify dining details, staff details along with some extra utilities tools (Note Taker) as well as making any announcement which will be seen in the user panel.

❖ User Panel: By login as an user, user will get the overall interface as an user where he/she can see the recent announcement from the hall administration as well as can complain about anything if it’s necessary related with hall management which will be monitored by the admin panel.
